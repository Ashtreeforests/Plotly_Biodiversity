# Plotly: Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository is complete the dashboard for Roza's dashboard. Her dashboard has a completed panel for demographic information and visualizations of the bacterial data for each volunteer. The goal of this dashboard is for her volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
